üìå FBX to GLB Conversion Guide
Convert FBX Files to GLB Using Blender‚Äôs Headless Mode
üöÄ This guide walks you through downloading, setting up, and running a script that converts FBX files to GLB using Blender‚Äôs Python API.

üì• Download & Install Requirements
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Blender
Download Blender from Blender.org
Install Blender and ensure it's added to your system PATH (so you can run blender in the terminal).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone This Repository
Run the following command in your terminal:

  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
  cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

3Ô∏è‚É£ Place Your FBX File
Move your .fbx file into the repository folder (or use an absolute path when running the script).

‚ö° How to Run the Script
Run the following command in Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux):

  blender --background --python convert_fbx_to_glb.py -- path/to/your/file.fbx

  Example:
  blender --background --python convert_fbx_to_glb.py -- D:\Models\character.fbx

‚úÖ This will generate a .glb file in the same directory as the .fbx file.

üõ† Troubleshooting
1. Blender is Not Recognized as a Command
If you see:

  'blender' is not recognized as an internal or external command

You need to add Blender to your system PATH:

 - Windows: Add C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.x\ to the Path environment variable.
 - Mac: Blender is usually located in /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender.
 - Linux: Install Blender via package manager (sudo apt install blender).
 - 
2. FBX Import Fails
   
 - Ensure your FBX file is valid and exported correctly.
 - Try opening it in Blender manually to confirm it's not corrupted.
